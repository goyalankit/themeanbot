Twitter Dictionary bot
----------------------

meet @themeanbot(a.k.a Mr Bot) on twitter. 

@themeanbot will fetch the meaning of any given word from online dictionary. 

Go to http://twitter.com/themeanbot You need to ask 'him' in a particular format to get a response:

    @themeanbot define YOUR_WORD
        
The bot will answer you back, whenever script executes. I plan to execute script at least once in a day or may be more that once.

Browse the code, it's quite basic..:)
